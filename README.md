# World Time Watchface

I work with teams all over the world and wanted a simple watchface that would show me the time wherever I am in the world today (local time) and the time in up to 6 other timezones at the same time. 

This is what I came up with. 

It auto scales to whichever device you own. 

It can support 6,4 or 2 additional timezones in addition to local time. 

## TODO

- Fix Garmin Icon and Bluetooth Icon
- Figure out how to configure using settings and not changing code
- Figure out how to use a background process to get timezone data from an API like https://timezonedb.com/
